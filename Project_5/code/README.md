## All code

>classes.py

Contains the class used for the entirety of the project. Is called in main.py

>functions.py

Contains a few functions used throughout the project to keep the code cleaner

>main.py

The main script. Contains a bunch of functions that handle and extract different values from the class in classes.py.

At the bottom you will find example runs used to obtain the results shown in the report. Be forewarned that even just one calculation takes a lot of time

I'd recommend commenting (or using an IDE like Spyder) and just running one function at a time.
