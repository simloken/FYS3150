## Heres the code

>main.py

The primary python file for use in this project. It automatically imports noclass.py. Run once then call a part of the project from the console

Example: proj_3b()

Additionally contains a function proj_3_full() which automatically calls all functions, a through i. Personally I recommend not using this as you'll get a bunch of plots all at once, which can be quite overwhelming

All functions, classes, etc. are explained above their respective function, class.

>noclass.py

The non-class/object version of our solution. Same as main.py, call from the console.
