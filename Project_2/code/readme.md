>functions.py 

functions.py contains all functions used in all in the project

>time.py

time.py checks time ran across three different algorithms

>tests.py

tests.py contains two different tests for validating our algorithms

>NvR.py

NvR.py plots Ns vs iterations of rotation/transforming in the Jacobi Algorithm

>JvB.py

JvB.py checks the runtime of the Jacobian solution against the runtime of the Bisection solution

>rdm.py

rdm.py is just a bunch of random leftover commented text to get random plots and outputs.
